# PCB Designs for International Rover Challenge 2025

These are the PCB designs built on KICAD for **Rover Orion**, built for the  
**IRC – International Rover Challenge 2025**

# What's in this Repository?
The PCB is a power dissipation board that can handle up to 180A current.
Driver Stage
  - XT60 connectors for 4 Motors, 2 14V Li-Po Batteries, and Kill Switch.
  - Tamiya and Buck Strip for ESP32 Microcontroller
Manipulator Stage
  - XT60 connectors for 6 Motors
  - Tamiya and Buck Strip for ESP32 Microcontroller

All schematics and PCB layouts are made in **KiCad** by me.  
The project files (`.kicad_pro`, `.kicad_sch`, `.kicad_pcb`) include the full circuit
diagrams for both the drive and manipulator sections on a single board.
